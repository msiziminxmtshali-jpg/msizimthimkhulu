										<p>In my profession as a Data Analyst, I showcase my skills through a diverse range of projects, both those assigned to me and those I undertake out of personal interest, all contributing to the strategic development of my career.</p>

										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ME.jpeg" alt="" /></span>As an ambitious, self-driven, and hardworking young professional, 
											I possess strong interpersonal, problem-solving, and time management skills, complemented by a National Senior Certificate obtained 
											from Kaalfontien Secondary School in December 2023. I deeply value teamwork and am adept at collaborating effectively within a group, 
											while also maintaining strong individual performance. My professional development includes a YLED Graduation Certificate, a YLED Top Ten Certificate, 
											and a Professional Foundation Certificate. I am currently enhancing my expertise through an intensive 7-month Data Analytics program at ALX Academy, 
											having started on March 1, 2025. This program is designed to cultivate advanced technical and analytical proficiencies, including mastery of 
											Microsoft software such as Excel and Power BI, and to refine my abilities in data-driven decision-making, problem-solving, and critical thinking. </p>
										
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/b.jpeg" alt="" /></span>My tenure as a Volunteer with the Youth Leadership & Entrepreneurship Development (YLED) program, 
										from March 1, 2022, to October 30, 2022, significantly shaped my professional capabilities. This comprehensive program, structured in two phases, first honed my 
										leadership skills, emphasizing interpersonal communication, goal setting, public speaking, and persuasive articulation. A notable project involved leading a 
										volunteer initiative to address Gender-Based Violence, which not only allowed me to gather resources for affected individuals but also significantly enhanced my 
										project management and collaborative leadership abilities. Subsequently, the entrepreneurship phase provided a platform to apply these skills commercially. 
										I co-founded "Beast Plug," an electronic accessories company, and served as its Financial Manager, a role that demanded meticulous attention to detail in presenting 
										our business model during a "Dragons' Den" competition and diligently managing the company's finances, including sales, cash flow, and profit tracking. 
										This rich, dual experience in community leadership and business management has instilled in me a proactive, solutions-oriented approach that I am enthusiastic 
										about contributing to the Systems Support program.<p>
											
									<p>My core competencies include an intermediate proficiency in Microsoft Office, encompassing Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, alongside intermediate skills 
										in Power BI and Tableau. I also possess beginner-level knowledge of SQL and Python. These technical skills are complemented by strong analytical abilities, 
										as well as effective verbal and written communication and presentation skills.</p>
